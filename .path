# Use GNU core utilities instead of those come with OS X
#
# The Homebrew coreutils formula installs the tools with g appended to their names -
# e.g. gcat instead of cat, etc. This is a workaround in order to use GNU version of tools
# i.e. without prefix 'g'.
#
# NOTE: Using gnubin will cause Homebrew warning:
#       "Putting non-prefixed coreutils in your path can cause gmp builds to fail."
#       However, I will leave it there since it haven't caused me any problem so far.
